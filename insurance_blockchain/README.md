### Testing

**Automated tests are located in the test directory as CropInsuranceNFT.test.js**

**Run Tests**
Execute:

```
npx hardhat test
```

**The tests cover:**

* Minting new policy NFTs with correct metadata.

* Claiming policies only by the NFT owner.

* Preventing double claims.

* Preventing claims after expiration.

* Validating access control on claims.

### Interacting with the Deployed Contract
You can interact with the deployed contract using:

* Hardhat console connected to Sepolia:

```
npx hardhat console --network sepolia
```
* Your frontend app using ethers.js or web3.js with the contract ABI and address:

```
